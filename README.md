# DayZ-Trader-Config-Editor
#Create and maintain realiable trader data with ease.

 This python command-line application allows for easy modification and error checking. This application requires that the format of the trader config be consistent with the default config of the current trader mod. 
 
- To modify a Trader config, the file must be named "trader.txt" and be in the same directory as the executable(trader_editor.exe or trader_editor.py).
- I would recommend making a copy of your trader file, just in case you make unwanted changes.
